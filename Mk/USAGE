	    build each/every package.

	    NOTE: Some packages may fail to build on certain operating systems.
	          For example, it is currently not possible to build a Linux
	          RPM on FreeBSD.

	depend_all
	    Performs `make depend' in all package directories, copying static
	    file dependencies (if configured) from the `depend' tree into the
	    given package sub-directory.

	forcedepend_all
	    Performs `make forcedepend' in all package directories, forcing the
	    copy of file dependencies (if configured) from the `depend' tree
	    overwriting local copies in the given package sub-directory.

Global Maintenance Targets:

	clean_all
	    Performs `make clean' in all package directories.

	distclean_all
	    Performs `make distclean' in all package directories.

	    Performs `make pull' in all package directories.

	commit_all

	    given package to the current package version.

	forcetag_all
	    Performs `make forcetag' in all package directories, tagging files
	    for a given package to the current package version even if already
	    tagged at a lower revision with the same tag.
