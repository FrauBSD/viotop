	          RPM on FreeBSD.

	    file dependencies (if configured) from the `depend' tree into the
	    given package sub-directory.

	forcedepend_redhat
	    Performs `make forcedepend' in all package directories, forcing the
	    copy of file dependencies (if configured) from the `depend' tree
	    overwriting local copies in the given package sub-directory.

	clean_redhat
	    Performs `make clean' in all package directories.
